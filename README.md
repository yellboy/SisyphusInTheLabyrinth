# Sisyphus in the Labytinth

You take a role of Sysiphus who magically finds himself in the Labyrinth in which Theseus defeated the minotaur. To escape from the Labyrinth, you must find the portal that leads out of it. Of course, being emotionally attached to your rock, you must bring rour rock to the portal as well.

## How to play?
You move by walking around naturally. The rock will tend to go in front of you and follow the velocity of your movement, but be carefull not to give it too much velocity in one direction. Also, try not to loose it from your sight.

Enjoy!

*Note: The portal is a pink rectangle placed somewhere in the Labyrinth. But it is not really implemented. Just try bringing the rock to it. :)*
